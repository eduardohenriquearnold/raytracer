Ray Tracer in a Weekend
========================

Decided to learn more about ray tracing and computer graphics. Implemented this simple ray tracing for spherical objects using C++ from scratch without any additional libraries.
Based on Peter Shirley's [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
